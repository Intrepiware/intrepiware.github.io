Mike has had a successful technology career spanning over 20 years. He currently serves as the Head of Engineering at [ePayPolicy](https://www.epaypolicy.com), a digital company that is revolutionizing payments in the insurance space. He lives in Austin with his beautiful wife Emily and their three kids. When he's not blogging or coding (or speaking of himself in third person), he's probably doing something fitness related, listening to the latest metal or punk albums, or watching Hurricanes hockey.

This blog is a space where Mike shares his thoughts on technology, software development, and leadership, as well as personal insights on fitness, music, and life in general.
