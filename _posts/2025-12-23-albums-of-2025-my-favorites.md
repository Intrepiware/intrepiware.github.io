My "Top 5" (note: actually six) albums released in 2025.

Being Mr. Practical, I rate albums based on replay-ability: which ones will I listen to years from now? This means gorgeous and otherwise deserving records miss the cut if I have no desire to hear them again ([Sharon Van Etten & The Attachment Theory](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/1110659-sharon-van-etten-sharon-van-etten-the-attachment-theory.php) is a great example).

| ![Wolf Alice "The Clearing" Album Cover](/assets/image/Wolf_Alice_-_The_Clearing.png) | **#5 (tie): The Clearing by Wolf Alice**<br />This album shines with catchy, beautiful melodies, several with 1970s folk rock vibes. The mixing is incredible. The tracks weave together effortlessly and boast lovely piano and strings instrumentation, which support Ellie Rowsell's soaring vocals. (Favorite track: "Sofa") |
| ![The Hives "The Hives Forever Forever the Hives" Album Cover](/assets/image/The_Hives_Forever_Forever_The_Hives_Album_Cover.jpg) | **#5 (tie): The Hives Forever Forever the Hives by the Hives**<br />This is a fun record and great energy boost. I haven't checked in with the Hives in twenty years, but their sound hasn't changed much. They still have that garage rock revival sound that made them famous (and landed them in iPod commercials). |
| ![Reneé Rapp "BITE ME" Album Cover](</assets/image/Renee_Rapp_-_Bite_Me_(album_cover).png>) | **#4: BITE ME by Reneé Rapp**<br />I decided I'm too old to impress people with my musical tastes and should just admit I like pop music. This album has several fun tracks (with "Leave Me Alone" the best). But between the sex- and alcohol-fueled party anthems, Reneé shows fascinating glimpses of emotional intelligence and self-awareness well beyond her twenty-five year age (see: "Mad", "Why Is She Still Here?" and "Good Girl"[^fn-good-girl]). |
| ![Samia "Bloodless" Album Cover](/assets/image/Samia_-_Bloodless.jpg) | **#3: Bloodless by Samia**<br />Samia crafts stunning melodies on this singer-songwriter album with beautiful instrumentation and singing that easily suck you in. Her lyrics are as opaque as ever with every track a little mystery, trying to unravel its meaning. Favorites: "Sacred", "North Poles", "Proof" |
| ![Pinkshift "Earthkeeper" Album Cover](/assets/image/Pinkshift_Earthkeeper.jpg) | **#2: Earthkeeper by Pinkshift**<br/>My most-played album of 2025, this record walks the line between metal and punk without committing to either one. It's a wild ride; thrashy and loud in some places, while quiet and introspective in others. The three middle tracks ("Patience", "Spiritseeker", "Blood") all blend beautifully into one long epic song. "Vacant" and "Love It Here" are also high-energy highlights. |
| ![Hayley Williams "Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party" Album Cover](/assets/image/Ego_Death_at_a_Bachelorette_Party_-_Hayley_Williams.png) | **#1: Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party by Hayley Williams**<br />An album that is honest, introspective, and a bit gossipy. She writes candidly about her relationships her exes Chad Gilbert and Taylor York. There are so many influences on this record: "Glum" sounds like a lost Ween recording, and she quotes Bloodhound Gang on "Discovery Channel". "Parachute" is the best track by far, but honestly all of the tracks hit for me except "Dream Girl in Shibuya" |

[^fn-good-girl]: Does "Good Girl" show self awareness? Gemini and I had a lively debate. Gemini, probably hallucinating, argued "[Good Girl] is less about deep self-reflection and more about liberation...explor[ing] the idea that being 'good' was actually a performance for others (like her father)." I say that Good Girl is Reneé's admission she can't control herself around one person in particular. She repeatedly assures us she had the best intentions, "just have one drink and leave, like a grown-up." But even while she's singing the song, she caves in _AGAIN_ and says "fuck it, baby, take me home."
