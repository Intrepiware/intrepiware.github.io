My "Top 5" (note: actually six) albums released in 2025.

Being Mr. Practical, I rate albums on replay-ability—which ones will I listen to years from now? This means otherwise gorgeous records don't make the cut if I have no desire to hear them again ([Sharon Van Etten & The Attachment Theory](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/1110659-sharon-van-etten-sharon-van-etten-the-attachment-theory.php) is a great example).

| ![Wolf Alice "The Clearing" Album Cover](/assets/image/Wolf_Alice_-_The_Clearing.png) | **#5 (tie): Wolf Alice - The Clearing**<br />This album shines with catchy, beautiful melodies, several with 1970s folk rock vibes. The tracks weave together effortlessly. I love the instrumentation: strings and piano support Ellie Rowsell's soaring vocals. (Favorite track: "Sofa") |
| ![The Hives "The Hives Forever Forever the Hives" Album Cover](/assets/image/The_Hives_Forever_Forever_The_Hives_Album_Cover.jpg) | **#5 (tie): The Hives - The Hives Forever Forever the Hives**<br />This is a fun record and great energy boost. I haven't checked in with the Hives in twenty years, but their sound hasn't changed much. They still have that garage rock revival sound that made them famous (and landed them in iPod commercials). |
| ![Reneé Rapp "BITE ME" Album Cover](</assets/image/Renee_Rapp_-_Bite_Me_(album_cover).png>) | **#4: Reneé Rapp - BITE ME**<br />I decided I'm too old to impress people with my musical tastes and should just admit I like pop music. This album has several fun tracks (with "Leave Me Alone" the best). But between the party anthems about sex and drinking, Reneé shows fascinating peeks of emotional intelligence and self-awareness well beyond her twenty-five year age (see: "Mad", "Why Is She Still Here?" and "Good Girl"[^fn-good-girl]). |
| ![Samia "Bloodless" Album Cover](/assets/image/Samia_-_Bloodless.jpg) | **#3: Samia - Bloodless**<br />Singer-Songwriter. Beautiful instrumentation, opaque lyrics. Favorites: Craziest Person, Sacred, North Poles |
| ![Pinkshift "Earthkeeper" Album Cover](/assets/image/Pinkshift_Earthkeeper.jpg) | **#2: Pinkshift - Earthkeeper**<br/>My most-played album of 2025, this record walks the line between metal and punk without committing to either one. It's a wild ride; thrashy and loud in some places, while quiet and introspective in others. The three middle tracks ("Patience", "Spiritseeker", "Blood") all blend beautifully into one long epic song. "Vacant" and "Love It Here" are also high-energy highlights. |
| ![Hayley Williams "Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party" Album Cover](/assets/image/Ego_Death_at_a_Bachelorette_Party_-_Hayley_Williams.png) | **#1: Hayley Williams - Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party**<br />Doobie doobie doooo... |

[^fn-good-girl]: Gemini and I had a lively debate about whether "Good Girl" shows self-awareness. "[Good Girl] is less about deep self-reflection and more about liberation," argues Gemini. "It uses a classic 80s synth-pop vibe to explore the idea that being 'good' was actually a performance for others (like her father)." I maintain that Good Girl is Reneé's admission she can't control herself around one person in particular. She repeatedly assures us she had the best intentions, "just have one drink and leave, like a grown-up." But even while she's singing the song, she caves in _again_ and says "fuck it, baby, take me home."
